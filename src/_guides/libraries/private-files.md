title: "What Not to Commit"
description: "Your development tools generate a bunch of files. Not all of them should be committed."
---

When you put Dart source code in a repository,
whether using the [pub](/tools/pub) tool, [GitHub](https://github.com/)
or another source code management system,
you shouldn't include most of the files
that your IDE or code editor, the pub tool, and other tools generate.

<aside class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
**Note:**
Except where noted, this page discusses only source code repositories,
_not_ app deployment.
Some files that you wouldn't normally put in a repository
are useful or essential when you deploy an app.
</aside>

## The rules

**Don't commit** the following files and directories
created by pub and dart2js:

{% prettify none %}
build/
packages/
pubspec.lock  // Except for application packages
.buildlog
.packages
.project
.pub/
{% endprettify %}

**Don't commit** the API documentation directory created by dartdoc:

{% prettify none %}
doc/api/
{% endprettify %}

**Don't commit** files and directories
dropped by other development environments.
For example:

{% prettify none %}
*.iml         // IntelliJ
*.ipr         // IntelliJ
*.iws         // IntelliJ
.idea/        // IntelliJ
.DS_Store     // Mac
{% endprettify %}

**Avoid committing** generated JavaScript files:

{% prettify none %}
*.dart.js
*.info.json      # Produced by the --dump-info flag.
*.js             # When generated by dart2js. Don't specify *.js if your
                 # project includes source files written in JavaScript.
*.js_
*.js.deps
*.js.map
{% endprettify %}

## Details

As a rule, you should commit only the files that people need
to use your package or source code repository.
Including additional files is unnecessary,
could be counterproductive,
and might even have security implications
if you expose details about your machine's setup.
In many source code repositories,
the common practice is not to commit generated files, at all.

See [Ignoring files](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files)
in the GitHub help for more information.

### .packages and packages/

The `.packages` file contains a list of dependencies used by your application.
Directories named `packages/` contain symlinks specific to your machine.
Users of your code should generate their own packages information
using [pub get](/tools/pub/get-started#installing-packages).

{% include packages-dir.html %}

### pubspec.lock

The `pubspec.lock` file is a special case,
similar to Ruby's `Gemfile.lock`.

**For library packages**, do **not** commit the `pubspec.lock` file.

**For application packages**, **do** commit `pubspec.lock`.
This file is the recommended way for non-shared resources
such as applications to manage their dependencies.

### *.js

Don't commit JavaScript files generated by dart2js. Just be careful
that you don't accidentally exclude source files written in JavaScript.

Calling dart2js without any flags generates `out.js`, but the
tools that invoke dart2js often specify an output name, such as:

{% prettify none  %}
dart2js -o main.dart.js main.dart
{% endprettify %}

JavaScript source for Dart apps, see the
[dart2js documentation]({{site.webdev}}/tools/dart2js).
